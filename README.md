# PDF-Viewer

Here is my implementation of a custom PDF viewer using the PDF.js library. I created this for my [website](https://itsjonathanthompson.com) (of which the files can be found [here]()) to better seamlessly integrate this pdf viewer with the style of the rest of my site. I've linked two demo pages below to experience it in action.

[PDF Viewer w/page styling]()
<br>
[PDF Viewer ONLY]()

It's pretty simple, only containing the necessary elements of a PDF viewer:
- A sidebar view with page thumbnails
- Page forward/backward buttons
- Page number input field
- Zoom in/Zoom out buttons
- Zoom seletion menu
- Download PDF button
- Print PDF button
- An expand button (which opens a modal view with the same features)

## The Future
Below is a list of things I want to or plan to add at some point in the future:
- [ ] Touch gestures (i.e. pinch to zoom, drag with two fingers, etc.)
- [ ] Increase resolution of pdf pages on smaller screens
- [ ] Selectable and searchable text
